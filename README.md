# How to use it

## Code side
Firstly, clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/masterdpro/sharex-custom-uploader-express
cd sharex-custom-uploader-express/
```
After, download the packages.

Open up ImageApi.js, change the **secret_key** and **domain_url** variables for whatever you want to use.
